# Peripheral Identifier (WIP)
Isolate PC peripherals in desk images and use them train a convolutional neural network to identify those peripherals by type (i.e. mouse, keyboard, etc.).
This will eventually be used to detect these peripherals in other images.
Used imgLabel to label all images.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- SKLearn

- Pillow
- Pandas
- OS
- XML ElementTrees

## TODO
- Expand dataset with new images
- Build detector
- Tweak model to improve accuracy
